Uses Gulp with SASS for development

- Install dependencies: `npm install --global yo gulp bower`
- Run `gulp serve` to preview and watch for changes
- Run `bower install --save <package>` to install frontend dependencies
- Run `gulp serve:test` to run the tests in the browser
- Run `gulp` to build your webapp for production
- Run `gulp serve:dist` to preview the production build

For the code blocks we use Pygments via http://tohtml.com. Just make sure you remove the inline styles from the `span` element.
